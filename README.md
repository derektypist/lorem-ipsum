# Lorem Ipsum

The purpose of the project is to provide the alternative to Lorem Ipsum using plain JavaScript, wihout any frameworks.  It can be foods, places, television programs, etc.  However, Google Fonts (e.g. to Access Font Roboto) will be used.

## UX

As a user, I expect the placeholder to appear on input fields.

As a user, If I do not enter a number, I get a random paragraph.

As a user, If I enter a number less than or equal to 0, I get a random paragraph.

As a user, If I enter a number greater than 9, I get a random paragraph.

As a user, If I enter a number between 1 and 9, I get the first n paragraphs.

The paragraph is a string array of 9 elements.  It can be foods, places, programming languages, colours, buildings, television programs, units of measurement, subjects at school and university and female celebrities.

## Features

Generates up to 9 paragraphs or a random paragraph if no input or number not between 1 and 9.

## Technologies

Uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Google Fonts.

## Testing

Ensure that all user stories have been met.

## Deployment

Deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://derektypist.github.io/lorem-ipsum) at the main branch.
